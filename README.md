## Credit and Collaborations

- I have received so much help from Tammy Do in particular on this project.  I'm certain she's dumped at least 3 hours into me directly.

- I continued work on labs 8-10 over the weekend on March 11th and 12th and solicited help from Steve Minor, an experienced React developer I've known for a very long time.
